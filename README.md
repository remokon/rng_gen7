# Gen 7 RNG with React.js

This was originally a project I did during some time off for fun that allows someone to do Gen 7 Egg RNG in their web browser.

## Features:
- Egg RNG with and without Masuda Method/Shiny Charm
- Timeline for Egg RNG without Masuda Method/Shiny Charm
- Safe frame search for accurate timeline usage
- Stationary Pokemon with and without sync
- Preset stationary settings for various Pokemon
- IV/Shiny filters
